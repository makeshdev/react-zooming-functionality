# React Image Zoom with Scrollbars

This React project implements an image zooming feature using the react-zoom-pan-pinch library. The zooming is pointer-centric, meaning it zooms in and out based on the mouse cursor's position.

### Features

1. Zoom In / Zoom Out: Users can zoom in and out on the image.
2. Pointer-Centric Zoom: The zoom focuses on the mouse position.
3. Dynamic Scrollbars: Scrollbars appear when the image overflows the container.
4. Responsive Design: Works on different screen sizes with proper scaling.

### Technologies Used

1. React.js – Frontend framework
2. react-zoom-pan-pinch – Zooming and panning library
3. CSS – For styling

### Code Structure

1. App.js – Contains the main component with zoom and pan functionality.
2. assets/bg.jpg – The sample image used for zooming.

### Usage

1. Zoom in/out: Use the mouse scroll or pinch gesture (on touch devices).
2. Pan: Click and drag the image when zoomed in.
3. Scrollbars: Appear dynamically when the zoom exceeds container size.
