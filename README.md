# React Image Zoom with Scrollbars

This React project implements an image zooming feature using the react-zoom-pan-pinch library. The zooming is pointer-centric, meaning it zooms in and out based on the mouse cursor's position.

### Features

1. Zoom In / Zoom Out: Users can zoom in and out on the image.
2. Pointer-Centric Zoom: The zoom focuses on the mouse position.
3. Dynamic Scrollbars: Scrollbars appear when the image overflows the container.
4. Responsive Design: Works on different screen sizes with proper scaling.

### Technologies Used

1. React.js – Frontend framework
2. react-zoom-pan-pinch – Zooming and panning library
3. CSS – For styling

### Code Structure

1. App.js – Contains the main component with zoom and pan functionality.
2. assets/bg.jpg – The sample image used for zooming.

### Usage

1. Zoom in/out: Use the mouse scroll or pinch gesture (on touch devices).
2. Pan: Click and drag the image when zoomed in.
3. Scrollbars: Appear dynamically when the zoom exceeds container size.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
